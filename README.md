# implement-of-OLELoss with pytorch
A simple implement of a paper from CVPR2018:OL_'E_ Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding, A Plug and Play Geometric Loss for Deep Learning

The paper has provided a implement on https://github.com/jlezama/OrthogonalLowrankEmbedding .But I find it has some mistakes(or it is my problem).Anyway, I combine its OLELoss function with an example from pytorch's intruduction to get a runable project on my computer.

The IDE I use is Pycharm,and the original OLELoss function raises some yellow warnings.I did try to fix it,but instead I got a lot of erros.But the original one did run well.So if you can correct that please do share it with me or if you have some problem, you can also contact me by email(793472951@qq.com).
